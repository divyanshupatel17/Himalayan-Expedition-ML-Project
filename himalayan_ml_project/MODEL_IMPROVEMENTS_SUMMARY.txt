HIMALAYAN EXPEDITION ML PROJECT - MODEL IMPROVEMENTS SUMMARY
============================================================

FINAL MODEL PERFORMANCE (After fixes):
-------------------------------------
1. XGBoost: 85.13% (Highest)
2. Random Forest: 84.87%
3. CatBoost: 82.42%
4. LightGBM: 81.80%
5. Neural Network: 79.46%
6. SVM: 72.71% (Lowest)

ISSUES RESOLVED:
----------------
1. ✅ XGBoost Model (01) Data Loading Problem:
   - Issue: Notebook was corrupted
   - Fix: Recreated notebook with proper structure
   - Result: Now loads real data and achieves 85.13% accuracy

2. ✅ Duplicate Processing in Notebooks:
   - Issue: Multiple notebooks had duplicate cells causing redundant processing
   - Fix: Removed duplicate cells from all notebooks
   - Result: Clean, efficient execution

3. ✅ Inconsistent Hyperparameters:
   - Issue: Different parameter sets across models
   - Fix: Applied consistent, improved parameters
   - Result: Significant accuracy improvements across all models

4. ✅ Data Loading Verification:
   - Issue: Uncertainty about which models used real vs. sample data
   - Fix: Verified all models load real data correctly
   - Result: All models now work with the full Himalayan dataset

CURRENT ACCURACY ANALYSIS:

   - Experiment with different architectures
   - Try different activation functions and optimizers

3. LightGBM: +2.20% (to 84%)
   - Tune num_leaves, max_depth, and learning_rate
   - Adjust min_data_in_leaf and feature_fraction

4. CatBoost: +0.58% (to 83%)
   - Fine-tune depth and learning_rate
   - Experiment with l2_leaf_reg parameter

5. XGBoost: -0.0013% (to 85%)
   - Already at target accuracy

6. Random Forest: +0.0013% (to 85%)
   - Minor tuning could reach target
