# Himalayan Expedition Success Prediction - ML Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a machine learning system to predict the success probability of Himalayan climbing expeditions. The system will use advanced feature engineering techniques, multiple ML algorithms, and hyperparameter optimization to achieve >90% accuracy for a classroom demonstration.

## 2. Recommended Models

### 2.1 Primary Models
1. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting algorithm, excellent for structured data
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble method, robust and interpretable
3. **LightGBM** - Fast gradient boosting framework
4. **CatBoost** - Categorical boosting, handles categorical features well
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Effective for high-dimensional spaces
6. **Neural Network** - Deep learning approach for complex patterns

### 2.2 Ensemble Methods
1. **Voting Classifier** - Combines predictions from multiple models
2. **Stacking Ensemble** - Meta-learner combines base model predictions
3. **Blending Technique** - Similar to stacking but uses validation set

## 4. Hyperparameter Optimization

### 4.1 XGBoost
```python
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 500],
    'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],
